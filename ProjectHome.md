# One More Music Player Client... #

As if there aren't enough music player applications out there, I present to you one more, the aptly named One More Music Player Client.

So, why do we need another front-end for mpd(the Music Player Daemon)? The answer lies in the intended audience.  Although designed to be cross platform through the use of SDL as a development toolkit, the target platform is Gamepark Holdings open source gaming and multimedia device the GP2X.  In the future the application will perhaps be fleshed out to be a viable desktop mpd client also, but the focus is currently a robust player for this gem of a console.

Someone mentioned a donate button, so here you go.  Personally I just find it cool that someone uses the player, but I'm not morally opposed to money or anything. :)

Now just thought I'd mention another project/interest, in case someone browsing through was interested.
