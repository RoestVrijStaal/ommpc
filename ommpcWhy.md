We've established that a mpd client for the GP2X isn't at all redundant, but why do we need another Music Player at all in the GP2X community.  Currently I believe there are three great options to choose from, [OldPlay](http://www.nightmode.org/oldplay/), [Gmu](http://wejp.k.vu/projects/gmu/), and [Craigamp](http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/Craigamp).  Well originally, it was just because none of them really "spoke" to me.  I'm sure I could get along just fine with any of them, but as I wanted a project and saw a few gaps that could be filled, I decided to go forward with ommpc.

The main features that seem to be requested often that all the current players seem to lack are...
  * Gapless Playback
  * Bookmarking for audio books
  * Background playback for other programs

By using mpd, we get the gapless playback for free with no effort.  Mpd also give us fast seeking, so we can pretty easily implement a bookmarking feature.  It's pretty light on resources, so we can underclock effectively and the daemon runs in the background, so we can start up another application like an text reader and still listen to our tunes...I hope it all falls together not and I can get everyone something new to play with...
