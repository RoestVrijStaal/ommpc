#summary Control list for ommpc.

I'm not thrilled with the control schema I've decided on, but I think it's as good as anything else out there.  It adheres to any "standard" buttons behaviour you might expect while being pretty functional.  The only strangeness comes in the fact that what is an action for a button press in one mode, moves to an action for a button hold in another.  

For example in playlist mode, 'B' is play and 'X' is stop since 'X' can be thought of the opposite of 'B' in alot of "standard" cases.  However in browser mode, 'B' is select or play depending on if it a folder or file but 'X' defaults to going back a directory since that is the default behaviour for file browsers on the GP2X.  Pressing and holding 'X' will stop the current song.

Anyway, without further ado...

*Browser Mode*
 * B - Select/Immediate Play
 * B(Hold) - Pause
 * X - Go back
 * X(Hold) - Stop
 * A - Append to end of playlist

*Playlist Mode*
As this player is playlist oriented, most player interaction happens here...
 * B - Play/Pause if currently playing song selected
 * B(Hold) - Pause
 * X - Stop
 * A(Hold) - Delete from playlist
 * Y - Initiate song move...then select where to move to and push Y again to finish.
 * L - Previous song
 * L(Hold) - Rewind
 * R - Next song
 * R(Hold) - Fast Forward

*Playlist Browser Mode*
 * B - Load Playlist
 * B(Hold) - Pause
 * X - Stop
 * A(Hold) - Delete playlist

*Bookmarks Mode*
 * B - Load Bookmark
 * B(Hold) - Pause
 * X - Stop
 * A(Hold) - Delete bookmark

*Global*
 * Select - Toggles modes
 * Select(Hold) - Toggles views in current mode(if any)
 * Start - Menu
 * Start(Hold) - Lock and blank screen.  Same to unlock/turn on.
